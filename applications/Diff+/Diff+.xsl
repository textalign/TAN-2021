    <!-- Welcome to Diff+, the TAN application that finds and analyzes text differences-->
    <!-- Version 2022-03-24 -->
    <!-- Take any number of versions of a text, compare them, and view and study all the text
        differences in an HTML page. The HTML output allows you to see precisely where one version
        differs from the other. A small Javascript library allows you to change focus, remove
        versions, and explore statistics that show quantitatively how close the versions are to each
        other. Parameters allow you to make normalizations before making the comparison, and to weigh
        statistics accordingly. This application has been used not only for individual comparisons,
        but for more demanding needs: to analyze changes in documents passing through a multistep
        editorial workflow, to compare the quality of OCR results, and to study the relationship
        between ancient/medieval manuscripts (stemmatology).-->

    <!-- This master stylesheet is the public interface for the application. The parameters you will most
      likely want to change are listed and documented below, to help you customize the application to suit
      your needs. If you are relatively new to XSLT, or TAN applications, see Using TAN Applications and
      Utilities in the TAN Guidelines for general instructions. If you want to avoid changing the master
      application file, use the accompanying configuration file. Or make a copy of this file and edit and
      run it directly. Or create and configure a transformation scenario in Oxygen, defining the relevant
      parameters as you like. If you are comfortable with XSLT, try creating your own stylesheet, then
      import this one, and customize the process. To access the code base, follow the link in the
      <xsl:include> at the bottom of this file. -->
    
    
    <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
    
    <!-- This is a MIRU Stylesheet (MIRU = Main Input Resolved URIs) -->
    <!-- Primary input: any XML file, including this one (input is ignored) -->
    <!-- Secondary input: one or more files -->
    <!-- Primary output: perhaps diagnostics -->
    <!-- Secondary output: for each detectable language in the secondary input: (1) an XML file with
      the results of tan:diff() or tan:collate(), infused with select statistical analyses; (2) a
      rendering of #1 in an interactive, visually engaging HTML form -->

    <!-- Nota bene: -->
    <!-- * This application is useful only if the input files have different versions of the same text 
        in the same language. -->
    <!-- * The XML output is a straightforward result of tan:diff() or tan:collate(), perhaps wrapped by
        an element that also includes prepended statistical analysis. --> 
    <!-- * The HTML output has been designed to work with specific JavaScript and CSS files, and the HTML 
        output will not render correctly unless you have set up dependencies correctly. Currently, the 
        HTML output is directed to the TAN output subdirectory, with the HTML pointing to the appropriate
        javascript and CSS files in the js and css directories. -->
    
    <!-- WARNING: CERTAIN FEATURES HAVE YET TO BE IMPLEMENTED-->
    <!-- * Revise process that reinfuses a class 1 file with a diff/collate into a standard extra
        TAN function.
    -->
    
    <!-- This application currently just scratches the surface of what is possible. New features are
        planned! Some desiderata:
        1. Support a single TAN-A as the catalyst or MIRU provider, allowing <alias> to define the groups.
        2. Support MIRUs that point to non-TAN files, e.g., plain text, docx, xml.
        3. Allow one to decide whether Venn diagrams should adjust the common area or not.
        4. Enhance options on statistics.

    <!-- PARAMETERS -->
    <!-- Many parameters relevant to this application are to be found at:
        ../../parameters/params-application.xsl
        ../../parameters/params-application-diff.xsl
        ../../parameters/params-application-language.xsl
        Any parameter in this file that begins "tan:" has a corresponding parameter in one of the
      files above, and will overwrite the default value given there. You might want to alter other
      parameters in the files above for this application. All you need to do is paste a copy of the
      element in this file, replacing the value with the one you prefer. The local parameter will
      overwrite the general one. For example, if you want differences between two texts to be
      letter-for-letter, not word-for-word, then paste the following into this file: <xsl:param
      name="tan:snap-to-word" as="xs:boolean" select="false()"/> Study the parameters to see what options
      are available.
 -->


    <!-- STEP ONE: PICK YOUR DIRECTORIES AND FILES -->

    <!-- What directories of interest hold the target files? The following parameters are provided as examples,
      and for convenince, in case you want to have several commonly used directories handy. See below for
      the main parameter to pick via variable name the directory or directories you want. -->
    <xsl:param name="directory-1-uri" select="'../../examples'" as="xs:string?"/>
    <xsl:param name="directory-2-uri" select="'../../../library-arithmeticus/evagrius/cpg2455'" as="xs:string?"/>

    <xsl:param name="directory-5-uri" select="'../../../promo/presentations/test/ring2'" as="xs:string?"/>
    
    <!-- What directory or directories has the main input files? Any relative path will be calculated
      against the location of this application file. Multiple directories may be supplied. Too many files?
      Results can be filtered below. -->
    <xsl:param name="tan:main-input-relative-uri-directories" as="xs:string*" select="$directory-4-uri"/>
    
    <!-- Alternatively, you can point to one or more plain text files, each with list of paths to files 
        that should be processed. Every path must start with "file:" and use regular slashes, e.g.,
        e.g., file:/d:/test/item.docx. This parameter is used by command line utilities, so if it is
        populated, the previous parameter will be ignored. The regular expression filters (see below)
        are still enforced. -->
    <xsl:param name="resolved-uris-to-lists-of-main-input-resolved-uris" as="xs:string*"/>

    <!-- What pattern must each filename match (a regular expression, case-insensitive)? Of the files 
        in the directories chosen, only those whose names match this pattern will be included. A null 
        or empty string means ignore this parameter. -->
    <xsl:param name="tan:input-filenames-must-match-regex" as="xs:string?" select="''"/>

    <!-- What pattern must each filename NOT match (a regular expression, case-insensitive)? Of the files 
        in the directories chosen, any whose names match this pattern will be excluded. A null 
        or empty string means ignore this parameter. -->

    <!-- Each diff or collation is performed against a group of files, and there may be one or more
        groups. How shall groups be created? Options:
        1. Detected language (default). Group by detected @xml:lang value; if not present in a particular
        file, assume it belongs to the predefined default language (see parameter $default-language).
        2. Filename only. Group by the filename of the files, perhaps after replacements (see parameter
        $filename-adjustments-before-grouping below).
        3. Filename and language, a synthesis of the previous two options.
    -->
    <xsl:param name="file-group-option" as="xs:integer" select="1"/>
    
    <!-- What changes if any should be made to a filename before attempting to group it with other files? The
      desired changes must be expressed as batch replacements. A batch replacement consists of a sequence
      of elements, each one with attributes @pattern and @replacement and perhaps attributes @flags and
      @message. For examples of batch replacements, see ../../parameters/params-application-language.xsl.
      Note, in most systems filenames are fundamentally not case-sensitive, but have mixed case.
      Therefore in this parameter an attribute flags="i" is normally desirable.

    refine your results, and create natural groups. -->

        will be ignored. -->

    <!-- In a given group of collations/diffs, should input be restricted to only top-level 
        divs whose @ns match? Note, this will automatically remove any input that is not a
        class 1 TAN(-TEI) file.

    <!-- What language should be assumed for any input text that does not have a language associated with it?

      German, etc. -->
    <xsl:param name="default-language" as="xs:string?" select="'eng'"/>
    
    <!-- Should non-TAN input be space-normalized before processing? Note, all TAN files will be space
        normalized before processing. -->
    <xsl:param name="space-normalize-non-tan-input" as="xs:boolean" select="false()"/>
    
    <!-- How do you wish to handle input files that are XML? Options:
        1. (default) Compare only the text values of the XML files. If a TAN or TAN-TEI file,
        only the normalized body text will be compared. For all other XML structures, the entire
        text will be taken into account.
        2. Treat the XML file as plain text. Choose this option if you are interested
        in comparing XML structures to each other. Each XML file will be serialized as a string and 
        compared.
        3. Load an XML file, convert to plain text later. Choose this option if you want to normalize
        your XML input, and perhaps adjust them, before they are compared later as strings. To do that
        adjustment, it is recommended you add templates to the mode prepare-input, keeping in mind that
        an important template is applied by Diff+ to the root element, to prepare it for grouping.
