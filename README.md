Want configure, develop, and explore TAN?

TAN has optional submodules for JavaScript dependencies in the output and maintenance subdirectories. To get these, use:
`git clone --recurse-submodules [GIT_SOURCE_PATH]`

Many new features and enhancements are planned for TAN. Participation is welcome. If you create or maintain a library of TAN files, share it.
