   attribute in-lang { xsd:language }
ptr-attr-modal =
   
   ## names a <modal> that qualifies the claim.
   
   ## Multiple values of @adverb are interpreted to mean "and" with intersection. No distribution takes place. @adverb="X Y" specifies that the claim is expressed in both X and Y modes. For example, adverb="not probably" means that the claim is probably not true.
   
   ## The sequence of multiple values of @adverb is immaterial. This attribute is not inheritable.
   attribute adverb { text }
ptr-attr-object =
   
   ## takes one or more ID refs of vocabulary items that serve as the grammatical object of a claim. For example, if you wish to say that work A is a commentary on work B, then @object would have the ID ref for work B. @object is used for simple idrefs. For complex objects such as data content or textual references you must use <object>.
   
   ## Multiple values of @object are interpreted to mean "and", resulting in distribution of the claim. E.g., object="X Y" means the claim is true about X and about Y.
   
   ## In RDF, the concept of object (the third element of a triple) is required. In TAN, the object is not required, since some <verb>s may be intransitive (e.g., "Charlie slept.").
   
   ## The sequence of multiple values of @object are immaterial.
   attribute object { text }
ptr-attr-place =
   
   ## restricts the domain of a <claim> to a specific <place>.
   
   ## Multiple values of @where are interpreted to mean "or" with union. Unlike most other attributes for <claim>, no distribution takes place. For example, where="X Y" means the claim occured in either X or Y or both.
   
   ## The sequence of multiple values of @where is immaterial.
   attribute where { text }
ptr-attr-scriptum =
   
   ## points to one or more ID refs of vocabulary items that are scripta (text-bearing objects).
   
   ## Multiple values of @scriptum are interpreted to mean "and", resulting in distribution of the claim.
   
   ## The sequence of multiple values of @scriptum is immaterial.
   attribute scriptum { text }
ptr-attr-subject =
   
   ## points to one or more ID refs of vocabulary items in <head> that serve as the grammatical subject of a claim. @subject within <body> indicates the default subject(s) for <claim>s. @subject is used for idrefs; data content, textual references, or complex objects must be encoded with <subject>.
   
   ## Multiple values of @subject are interpreted to mean "and", resulting in distribution of the claim. E.g., subject="X Y" means the claim is true about X and about Y.
   
   ## The sequence of multiple values is immaterial.
   attribute subject { text }
ptr-attr-units =
   
   ## points to the ID ref of a <unit>, identifying the type of unit.
   attribute units { text }
ptr-attr-verb =
   
   ## points to one or more <verb>s that serve to assert something of the subject.
   
   ## The TAN term "verb" is the preferred equivalent to RDF "predicate."
   
   ##  Multiple values of @verb are interpreted to mean "and", resulting in distribution of the claim. E.g., verb="X Y" means the claim is true for verb X and verb Y. Any claim with multiple verbs must observe the constraints of each verb.
   attribute verb { text }
ptr-attr-work =
   
   ## refers via idrefs to one or more works. The ensuing claim(s) will be considerd to be true of any sources that share the same work.
   
   ## If you wish to avoid making a claim applying to all other versions of a work, use @src instead.
   
   ## Multiple values of @work are interpreted to mean "and", resulting in distribution of the claim. E.g., work="X Y" means the claim is true for both work X and work Y.

element-at-ref =
   
   ## restricts a claim to a particular abstract textual reference. 
   
   ## <at-ref> was designed primarily to serve claims related to apparatus critici. In traditional critical editions, the main text has an apparatus at the bottom of the page, indicating variations in the manuscript, e.g., "A om." or "A: γάρ". These terse statements are shorthand for: "Manuscript A omits the passage at line X word Y" and "Manuscript A reads γάρ in place of the passage at line X word Y." In those statements, the siglum A refers to the subject, and the reading (or lack thereof) is the object. The qualifier "at line X word Y" is the phrase that corresponds to <at-ref>. It functions much like <where>, but the geography is textual rather than spatial. 
   
   ## <at-ref> is special, and must be explicitly allowed or required by each <verb> or @verb's IRI + name pattern plus constraints.

If you have used an IRI for <work> that you are entitled to modify, you may wish to add a suffix that will name the version. If you need to specify exactly where on a text-bearing object a version appears, <desc> or <comment> should be used.
