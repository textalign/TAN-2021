   ## names a <div> or <group>, or refers to a <div>'s @n. 
   
   ## @n may consist of one or more values, space delimited, which are to be treated as synonyms.
   
   ## Any itemized value of @n may be numerical on non-numerical. A numerical value follows one of the supported TAN numeration systems, with commas and hyphens to refer to build sequences or ranges. The order of numerical items in an @n are significant. For example n="6, 8" signifies that the text straddles reference 6 then 8. But n="8, 6" signifies the converse. In the context of a <div>, the implication is that in neither case can the text be securely disentangled so as to create one <div> for 6 and another for 8.
   
   ## The hyphen-minus, - (U+002D, the most common form of hyphen), is reserved to specify a range. This feature is useful for cases where a <div> straddles more than one standard reference number (e.g., a translation of Aristotle that cannot be easily tied to Bekker numbers). 
   
   ## If you need to use a hyphen-like character in an @n that does not specify a range, consider ‐ (U+2010 HYPHEN), ‑ (U+2011 NON-BREAKING HYPHEN), ‒ (U+2012 FIGURE DASH), – (U+2013 EN DASH), or − (U+2212 MINUS SIGN).
   
   ## The comma is reserved to delimit items in a sequence of references. 
   
   ## The space is reserved to separate synonymous values, or to pad commas and hyphens. If you wish to use a value of @n that should not be split at the space, use the underbar, _, instead. 
   
   ## @n does not permit non-word characters, e.g., the period/full stop or colon. Such non-word characters need to be used by @ref to connect @n's.
   
   ## Because @n is used to construct @ref, it is indirectly cumulatively inheritable. See main.xml#inheritable_attributes.
