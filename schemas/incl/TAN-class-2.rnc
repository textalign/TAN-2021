attr-ref-many =
   
   ## lists references to one or more <div>s. It consists of one or more simple references joined by commas or hyphens. A simple reference is a string value that points to a single <div> by joining one of its values of @n with those of its ancestors, e.g., "1 1". 
   
   ## Truncation is allowed. For example, 1 1 - 3 will be interpreted first as 1.1 through 1.3; if that is invalid, it will be interpeted as 1.1 through 3. Another example: '2.4 - 7, 9' and 'ii iv - vii, 9' will be treated as identical, to mean 2.4 through 2.7 and 2.9.
   
   ## In a range with members of uneven depth, those complete <div>s that are closest to the shallowest member are retrieved. For example, 2 - 4 2 2 might fetch 2, 3, 4.1, and 4.2.1, 4.2.2 (and not 4 as a whole).

   ## This attribute is taken into account before all other attributes. That is, @claimant is to be interpreted to mean: "@claimant states the following:...." Multiple values of @claimant are interpreted to mean "and", resulting in distribution of the claim (e.g., claimant="x y" becomes "x claims that..." and "y claims that...").
   
   ## In a TAN-A file, nested @claimants mean that claimant X claims that claimant Y claims that... and so forth.

For example, <equate n="pr pref preface introduction"/> specifies that sources with <div> @n values of either "pr", "pref", "preface", or "introduction" should be treated as equivalent. Hence, in the <body> any @ref="pr" will also match a <div n="introduction"/>
   
   ## This element does not imply that the @n values are the same. It merely states that, for the purposes of this class-2 file, they should be treated as equivalent.
   
   ## Only the first <equate> applying to a <div> in a given source will be applied.

adj-element-rename =
   
   ## provisionally reassigns values of @n's in class 1 sources, or their calculated ref value, to another value.
   
   ## A <rename> may be applied on the basis of either @n or @ref, but a ref-based <rename> always supersedes an n-based rename. Only the first matching <rename> will be applied to a given <div> in a source.
   
   ## A ref-based rename eliminates any alternative values of @n, inherited or native. That is, if a <div> has @n="prol pref" and the rename has @ref="prol" and @new="prologue" then the alternative value "pref" will be ignored.
   
   ## Renames override any equate actions. An exception is made when an n-based rename affects one value of @n but an equate affects another value. Ref-based renames always override any equate action.
   
   ## If a <div> is renamed such that it needs to be moved elsewhere in the hierarchy, and it matches the reference of another <div>, the text from the renamed <div> will be added to the end of the target <div>.

   ## Note, the shallow skip of a <div> may result in the creation of empty <div>s, which will be ignored during validation.
   
   ## This element is useful for ignoring extraneous divs, e.g., where a source has introduced divs that do not exist in other versions of the same work. For example, a transcription may group the topmost divisions of a text into parts, or may adopt superfluous divisions (e.g., introducing a <div> for chapter in the New Testament book Philemon, which does not have more than one chapter, and can be identified purely by verse).

   ## identifies one or more tokens (words or word fragments). Used by class-2 files to make claims about specific words. 
   
   ## In TAN-A and TAN-A-tok files, <tok> does not necessarily carry linguistic connotations; in TAN-A-lm, it normally does.
   
   ## Most <tok>s are restricted to a single token, or a portion of a single token, perhaps filtered by the value of @chars. But they can refer to multiple tokens through multiple values of @src, @ref, and @pos, to save space and perhaps enhance legibility. For example, <tok src="a b" ref="1.1 - 1.3" pos="1-4"> would point to 24 tokens (assuming that the two sources each have at least four tokens in the three references 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3).
   
   ## If you wish to treat multiple word fragments as a single token, use <group>.
   
   ## The sequence of consecutive <tok>s is immaterial in the context of TAN-A-lm, and TAN-A-tok, except in the context of <group>, where the sequence dictates how the new token is to be constructed.
